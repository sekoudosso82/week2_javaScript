typeof is a special operator in JavaScript.

Create a variable using the let keyword and try to

JavaScript is dynamically typed which allows us to

Using typeof null is deceiving. 
This result is an "accident" because of the 
way that javascript was first defined. 
The actual type of null is indeed null.

It should be used to represent the absence

//The final primitive is Symbol.
