/*Explanation
myVariable is accessible outside of the block 
in which it was created. Also, note it's declaration
was hoisted. Thus, we can access myVariable
outside of the block and before we defined it.*/

//This produces an error because it's 
//outside of the block in which it was defined
// console.log(myOtherVariable);

cuased by accessing const outside of the block. */
