/*Explanation
A block of code is defined by {}. Everything in between 
Those curly braces is considered in the block. 
Anything else is outside of the block. 

If statements allow us to run a block of code only if a 
specific condition is true. 
If the condition in the parentheses is true the block 
following the the parentheses will run. 

We can optionally have an else statement that will run 
only if the other block doesn't run.
